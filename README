A little library that provides C calls for I2C communication on AVR devices.

There are synchronous and asynchronous versions of these calls.
Be aware that the asynchronous versions can easily suffer from underflow problems on sending and overflow on receiving
  if the microcontroller runs for too long without supplying new data or new memory.
